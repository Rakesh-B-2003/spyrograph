Assuming you are referring to the Python library for drawing mathematical curves called Spyrograph, 
the following is a sample requirements.txt file you can use to install the necessary dependencies.

#Code
numpy==1.22.2
matplotlib==3.5.1

You can copy and paste the above lines into a file named 'requirements.txt', and then install the 
dependencies using 'pip' by running the following command in your terminal.

#Code
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install NumPy and Matplotlib, which are the required dependencies for Spyrograph.
